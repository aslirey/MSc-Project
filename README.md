COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TRAFFIC PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The aim of this project was to examine the structure of communication networks and to introduce a data-driven architecture for the practical applications of machine learning techniques to predict data traffic on a network. 

Objectives:

-To examine the existing machine learning implementations in communication networks;

-Processing of the dataset to make it easy to use; 

-Implementation of machine learning algorithms;

-Evaluation of accuracy.


Dataset:  The Telecom Italia Big Data

This dataset provides information about the telecommunication activity over the city of Milano. The dataset is the result of a computation over the Call Detail Records (CDRs) generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. CDRs log the user activity for billing purposes and network management.
