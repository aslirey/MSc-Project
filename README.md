COMMUNICATION NETWORKS TRAFFIC PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The aim of this project was to examine the structure of communication networks and to introduce a data-driven architecture for the practical applications of machine learning techniques to predict data traffic on a network. 

Objectives:
-To examine the existing machine learning implementations in communication networks;
-Processing of the dataset to make it easy to use; 
-Implementation of machine learning algorithms;
-Evaluation of accuracy.
